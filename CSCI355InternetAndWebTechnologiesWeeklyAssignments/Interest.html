	<p>Meditation is a practice where an individual uses a technique such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought, or activity to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state. Scholars have found meditation elusive to define, as practices vary both between traditions and within them. Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions. The earliest records of meditation (dhyana) are found in the ancient Indian texts known as the Vedas, and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of Hinduism and Buddhism. Since the 19th century, Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have also found application in non spiritual contexts, such as business and health.</p>

<p>Meditation may significantly reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain, and enhance peace, perception, self concept, and well being. Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of meditation on health (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other areas.</p>

<tr>
<th>The Types of Meditation</th>
<th>Techniques</th>
<th>Consequences</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mindfulness Meditation</td>
<td>In mindfulness meditation, you pay attention to your thoughts as they pass through your mind. You don’t judge the thoughts or become involved with them. You simply observe and take note of any patterns. This practice combines concentration with awareness. You may find it helpful to focus on an object or your breath while you observe any bodily sensations, thoughts, or feelings.</td>
<td>This type of meditation is good for people who don’t have a teacher to guide them, as it can be easily practiced alone.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Spiritual Meditation</td>
<td>Spiritual meditation is used in Eastern religions, such as Hinduism and Daoism, and in Christian faith.It’s similar to prayer in that one reflect on the silence around oneself and seek a deeper connection with the God or Universe. Essential oils are commonly used to heighten the spiritual experience.</td>
<td>Spiritual meditation can be practiced at home or in a place of worship. This practice is beneficial for those who thrive in silence and seek spiritual growth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Focused Meditation</td>
<td>Focused meditation involves concentration using any of the five senses.For example, you can focus on something internal, like your breath, or you can bring in external influences to help focus your attention.Try counting mala beads, listening to a song, or staring at a candle flame.This practice may be simple in theory, but it can be difficult for beginners to hold their focus for longer than a few minutes at first.If your mind does wander, it’s important to come back to the practice and refocus.</td>
<td>As the name suggests, this practice is ideal for anyone who requires additional focus in their life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Movement Meditation</td>
<td>Although most people think of yoga when they hear movement meditation, this practice may include walking through the woods, gardening, qigong, and other gentle forms of motion.It’s an active form of meditation where the movement guides you.</td>
<td>Movement meditation is good for people who find peace in action and prefer to let their minds wander.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mantra Meditation</td>
<td>Mantra meditation is prominent in many teachings, including Hindu and Buddhist traditions. This type of meditation uses a repetitive sound to clear the mind. It can be a word, phrase, or sound, such as the popular “Om.”It doesn’t matter if the mantra is spoken loudly or quietly. After chanting the mantra for some time, one will be more alert and in tune with his/her environment. This allows one to experience deeper levels of awareness.</td>
<td>Some people enjoy mantra meditation because they find it easier to focus on a word than on their breath. This is also a good practice for people who don’t like silence and enjoy repetition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Transcendental Meditation</td>
<td>Transcendental Meditation is a popular type of meditation. This practice has been the subject of numerous studies in the scientific community. It is more customizable than mantra meditation, using a mantra or series of words that are specific to each practitioner.</td>
<td>This practice is for those who like structure and are serious about maintaining a meditation practice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Progressive Relaxation</td>
<td>Also known as body scan meditation, progressive relaxation is a practice aimed at reducing tension in the body and promoting relaxation.Oftentimes, this form of meditation involves slowly tightening and relaxing one muscle group at a time throughout the body.In some cases, it may also encourage you to imagine a gentle wave flowing through your body to help release any tension.</td>
<td>This form of meditation is often used to relieve stress and unwind before bedtime.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Loving-kindness Meditation</td>
<td>Loving-kindness meditation is used to strengthen feelings of compassion, kindness, and acceptance toward oneself and others. It typically involves opening the mind to receive love from others and then sending a series of well wishes to loved ones, friends, acquaintances, and all living beings.</td>
<td>Because this type of meditation is intended to promote compassion and kindness, it may be ideal for those holding feelings of anger or resentment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Visualization Meditation</td>
<td>Visualization meditation is a technique focused on enhancing feelings of relaxation, peace, and calmness by visualizing positive scenes or images.With this practice, it’s important to imagine the scene vividly and use all five senses to add as much detail as possible.Another form of visualization meditation involves imagining yourself succeeding at specific goals, which is intended to increase focus and motivation.</td>
